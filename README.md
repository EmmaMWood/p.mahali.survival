data for Wood &amp; Young paper: Telomere attrition predicts reduced survival in a wild social bird, but short telomeres do not
 
The following files will be uploaded on acceptance of the paper, but will be made available to reviewers on request from emmamwood85@gmail.com

Files:    
Wood_Young_Nestling_Survival_Delta_RTL.csv: data for investigating the effect of change in nestling telomere length on survival,  
Wood_Young_Nestling_Survival_D12_RTL: data for investigating the effect of nestling telomere length at day 12 on survival,  
Wood_Young_Nestling_Survival_D4_RTL: data for investigating the effect of nestling telomere length at day 4 on survival   
   
Column names and descriptions for all files:  

BIRD_ID: unique code given to individual birds    
    
D4.Mass: Estimated mass of nestlings at day 4 (see explanation for D12.Mass)

D12.Mass: Estimated mass of nestlings at day 12 (Nestling mass was taken on the day of sampling, but due to fast growth during this period we adjusted these mass measures, to provide an expected mass for each nestling at either 4 or 12 days of age, using the slope from a linear model of mass on age for nestlings between 3 and 6, and 10 and 13 days of age respectively. To calculate this adjustment, we used all relevant nestling mass measures available from our long-term field study (day 4 mass adjustment slope = 2.81g/day, n = 564 nestlings; day 12 mass adjustment slope = 1.92g/day, n= 390 nestlings).)  

Age.next.season: The number of days between hatching and the next October 1st    

RTL.4: RTL at day 4  

RTL.12 RTL at day 12

dtel.days: change in RTL per day between D4 and D12  

Pre.Rain: rainfall over the month prior to egg-laying (mm)    

Post.Rain: rainfall over the period from egg-laying to day 30 of the nestling period (mm)

Group: Unique codes for each social group    

Birth.Clutch: unique code for each brood  

Chick.Fate: F=fledged, NF=survived to day 16 but never seen outside the nest, D=dissappeared during the nestling period, P=nestling disappeared and signs predation present, E=found dead in the nest  

Predation: whether nestlings were likely predated, predated, expired, likely expired or survived during the nestling period   
  
Surv.next.ssn: 1=Nestling survived to the following breeding season, 0=nestling was never seen in the following season   
   
fledged: 1=nestling seen as a fledgling, 0=no evidence that nestling successfully fledged
